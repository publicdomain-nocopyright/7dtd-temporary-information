These ways are used to achieve more zombies in the overall world on 7DTD Vanilla Public Server

Instructions:
1. Paste the mod from the `mods` folder into your own **dedicated server** or even your **7DTD Client**..  
2. Restart the dedicated server (or your 7DTD Client if you applied this mod to your client only).  
3. Connect to your dedicated server as a player; or play/continue existing single player world.  

`serverconfig.xml` changes are not needed for improvements to be visible,  
but it's recommended for Dedicated Servers that have more players than 2-3 online.
